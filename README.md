#The server-client socket program is very much basic socket program and deals with only localhost(within same network)

#The chatserver & chatclient is more over an TCP-chatroom works with different network when ip of server is known.

#If any error exists similar like "UN AVAILABLE SERVICE or SERVICE ALREADY IN USE" open the program file in nano change the port number and run again.

#Make sure both client and server here update with same port(chat-room)

#Further this repository may include developed code in upcomming days
